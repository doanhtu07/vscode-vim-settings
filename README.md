# VSCode Vim Settings 

This is the repo for my collections of useful Vim shortcuts and bindings for VSCode.

My goal is to keep it as simple as possible, so we can stick with Vim Motions for the most part.

- settings.json: This is for `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` 

    - NOTE: settings.json inside .vscode is just for me to format my repo, not relevant to our Vim settings

- keybindings.json: This is for `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`

# VSCode Shortcuts for Terminals

- `` Ctrl + ` ``: Open terminal (**Default**)

    - Search for `Terminal: Create New Terminal` and set the shortcut yourself

- `` Ctrl + Shift + Backspace ``: Delete terminal (Must be set on our own)

    - Search for `Terminal: Kill the Active Terminal Instance` and set the shortcut yourself

- `` Cmd + Shift + [ or ] ``: Navigate between terminals (**Default**)

## Resources to learn Vim Motions

- For some references, I practiced Vim by doing the `vimtutor` on Mac Terminal. I think this exists on Windows too.

- I also watch some parts of the series `Vim as your editor` on Youtbue by `ThePrimeagen`
