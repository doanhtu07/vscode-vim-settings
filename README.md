# VSCode Vim Settings

This is the repo for my collections of useful Vim shortcuts and bindings for VSCode.

My goal is to keep it as simple as possible, so we can stick with Vim Motions for the most part.

But of course, I have added some of my preferences for VSCode.

- `settings.json`: This is for `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`

- `keybindings.json`: This is for `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`

There are 2 guides:

- One for machines with `Cmd` key: [MacOS](./docs/macos.md)
- The other for machines with no `Cmd` key: [Windows](./docs/windows.md)

## Resources to learn Vim Motions

- For some references, I practiced Vim by doing `vimtutor` on Mac Terminal. I think this exists on Windows too.

- I also watch some parts of the series `Vim as your editor` on Youtube by `ThePrimeagen`

## Cool extensions with VS Code
